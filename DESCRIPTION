Title: Censored data imputation for direct modeling
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yizhuo Wang, Xuelin Huang, Ziyi Li and Christopher R. Flowers

Description: Impute the survival times for censored observations based on their conditional survival distributions derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. CondiS can replace the censored observations with the best approximations from the statistical model, allowing for direct application of machine learning-based methods. When covariates are available, CondiS is extended by incorporating the covariate information through machine learning-based regression modeling (CondiS-X), which can further improve the imputed survival time.
